# Progress Log - Bookmark Manager App

## February 10, 2025

### Major Changes

1. Removed Shared Collection Functionality
   - Removed `/app/shared` route and its components
   - Simplified collection components by removing sharing features
   - Removed public/private toggle from collections
   - Files affected:
     - Deleted: `app/shared/[collectionId]/page.tsx`
     - Modified: `components/collections/CollectionCard.tsx`
     - Modified: `components/collections/CollectionForm.tsx`
     - Modified: `components/collections/CollectionContent.tsx`

### Previous Issues Fixed

1. Next.js 15 Route Parameters Promise Type Issue
   - Problem: Type error with params and searchParams not being recognized as Promises
   - Solution: Updated PageProps interface in both protected and shared collection pages
   - Files affected:
     - app/(protected)/collections/[id]/page.tsx
     - app/shared/[collectionId]/page.tsx (now removed)
   - Changes:
     ```typescript
     interface PageProps {
       params: Promise<{ id: string }>
       searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
     }
     ```
   - Added await for both params and searchParams in the component functions

2. Bookmark Type Casting Issue
   - Problem: Type mismatch between database query result and Bookmark type
   - Solution: 
     - Updated the Supabase query to include all required fields
     - Fixed type casting for bookmarks array
     - Added proper null handling with default empty array
   - Files affected:
     - app/shared/[collectionId]/page.tsx (now removed)

### Breaking Changes Handled

1. Next.js 15 Async Route Parameters
   - Route parameters (params and searchParams) are now passed as Promises
   - Required explicit awaiting of parameters before use
   - Updated type definitions to reflect the new Promise-based approach

### Current Status
- Removed shared collection functionality to simplify the application
- Fixed type errors related to Next.js 15 route parameters
- Improved type safety in database queries
- Enhanced null handling for bookmark relations

### Next Steps
- Test the application thoroughly after removing shared functionality
- Consider adding error boundaries for better error handling
- Review and update other routes if similar type issues exist
- Consider implementing alternative sharing mechanisms in the future if needed
